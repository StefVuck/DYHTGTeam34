# Glasgow University Tech Society Hackathon Team 34

Group Repo for Team 34 Do You Have The Guts Hackathon.
This was the challenge for the company [GuitarGuitar](https://www.guitarguitar.co.uk/). 

Our spec can be found in [here](https://github.com/StefVuck/DYHTGTeam34/blob/main/DYHTG34/assets/guts.pdf), but the general idea was:

> For this years Do You Have The GUTS Hackathon, we ask you to create an
innovative customer order viewer/page. We want you to take the data we provide,
explore it and see if you can come up with a creative way to view, filter, navigate,
slide or even play through! Be as creative as you like!
We recently have introduced myguitarguitar to the business, which you can make
use of and sign up for today on our live site! We have provided a loyalty level in the
customer data, so take this into consideration in your development.
